#pragma aid Fail Missing Data Policy Child Poll Order

//## Error handling policies defines what the nursery does with
//## RES_FAIL and RES_MISSING results from its children when polling
//## in synchronous mode (i.e. via syncPoll()). Note that in async mode
//## no error handling is done at all; async pollers are expected to
//## handle this themselves.
//
//## The policies for handling RES_FAIL and RES_MISSING can be set
//## independently below. The following policies are available:

//## Default policy is to poll all children and collect their results.
//## * all children are polled
//## * for FAIL mode only: all FAIL results are collected into the Result object
//## * Cumulative result code will contain RES_FAIL or RES_MISSING
#pragma aid CollectPropagate

//## The abandon & propagate policy works as follows:
//## * polling stops as soon as one child returns a fail or missing data
//## * for FAIL mode only: any FAIL results are collected into the Result object
//## * Cumulative result code will contain RES_FAIL or RES_MISSING
#pragma aid AbandonPropagate

//## The ignore policy works as follows:
//## * all children are polled
//## * fail results and missing results are not checked at all
//## * RES_FAIL and RES_MISSING is not returned in the cumulative code,
//##   it is up to the calling Node to handle child results

    //## =============== SYNCHRONOUS POLLING METHODS

    //## Polls all enabled children synchronously (i.e. does not return
    //## until poll is complete).
    //## Returns the cumulative result code (i.e. a bitwise or of the child
    //## return codes). If an Ignore policy is in effect for fails
    //## or missing data, the RES_FAIL or RES_MISSING bit will be cleared from
    //## the cumulative code.
    //## If the aborting() flag is raised during polling, returns
    //## RES_ABORT.
    //## If an async poll or background poll is in progress (see below),
    //## throws an exception.
    //## Postconditions:
    //##  * If RES_ABORT is returned, nothing may be assumed. Otherwise:
    //##  * Each valid and enabled child (isChildEnabled(n)==true)
    //##    will have a valid result in childres[n], unless a
    //##    AbandonPropagate policy is in effect: in this case some

    //## =============== ASYNC POLLING METHODS

    //## Async mode is employed when a caller can usefully process the child
    //## results one by one. Nodes with many children (such as the Solver)
    //## make use of this mode to minimize their memory use.
    //## In async mode, the caller initiates the polling process by calling
    //## the startAsyncPoll() method. This returns the number of children
    //## that will be polled (and in mt-mode, starts executing the children
    //## in parallel threads). The caller then repeatedly calls
    //## awaitChildResult() to fetch the results one by one, until -1
    //## is returned (see below).
    //## Child return codes are retained and may be accessed later via
    //## childRetcode().
    //## Once an async poll is in progress, no other polls may be initiated until
    //## the async poll ends (i.e. awaitChildResult() returns -1, or finishPoll()
    //## or abortPoll() is called). If startAsyncPoll() returns 0 (i.e. no
    //## children to be polled), the poll is not considered to have started.
    //## If another async poll or a background poll is in progress, throws
    //## an exception.

    //## Waits for a child to return a result, returns it in (rescode,resref).
    //## Return value:
    //##  * the child number
    //##  * -1 once all children have returned and poll is ended (or if no
    //##    poll was in progress)
    //## Postconditions:
    //##  * resref is valid, unless -1 is returned
    int  awaitChildResult (int &rescode,Result::Ref &resref,const Request &req);

    //## Returns true if an async poll is in progress
    bool asyncPollInProgress () const
    { return async_poll_in_progress_; }

    //## Does an background poll. This is normally used for stepchildren, when
    //## we want to send them a request but are not interested in a result.
    //## In single-threaded mode, this method will not return until the poll
    //## is completed. In mt mode, the method may return immediately
    //## and do the poll truly in the background (depending on the availability
    //## of CPUs/worker threads).
    //## Child return codes are retained and may be accessed later via
    //## childRetcode(). Child results are discarded.
    //## If another poll is in progress, throws an exception.

    //## in mt-mode, waits for it to complete before returning.
    void finishPoll ();

    //## Called to abort a poll. The difference with finishPoll() is only
