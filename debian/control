Package: libmeqtrees-timba0
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, casarest
Description: implementing and solving arbitrary Measurement Equations
 MeqTrees is a software package for implementing Measurement Equations. This
 makes it uniquely suited for simulation and calibration of radioastronomical
 data, especially that involving new radiotelescopes and observational
 regimes.
 .
 MeqTrees includes a highly capable FITS viewer and sky model manager called
 Tigger, which can also work as a standalone tool.
